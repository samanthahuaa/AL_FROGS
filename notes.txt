DISCO:
 * To stop a loop in the middle of running, make the method 
   return a boolean and put return true where you want it to
   end.
 * To access a ArrayList<Integer> instead of using .length or
   _data[i], you must use the ArrayList methods like .size() 
   and _data.get(i), because its type ArrayList not type array. 
 * ArrayList<Integer> allows us to specify that ArrayList will
   only contain Integer values.

QCC:
 * How do we know if OrderedArrayList.java is connected to/wrapper
   class for ALTester.java
 * How do we stop a loop from finishing running without having to
   return a boolean?
 * Is there a way to implement addBinary without creating two seprate
   cases for when the ArrayList has a size of 0 or 1?
